ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing a PhD in computer science, working on Spiking
neural networks (SNNs) and their interactive analytics. <br><br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Pytorch and how to exploit it using
Flutter for mobile based applications around Ai.<br><br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to my research topic or any interesting project related to Ai.
<br><br>
I am a fullstack developer with a couple of years experience in
different fields, mainly mobile development. A big fan of Linux and
Open Source.<br><br>
I am a co-organiser at Google Developers Group chapter of Ghardaia, a Flutter trainer and
member at the CSO (club scientifique des oasis).<br><br>
I was lucky to be a speaker at different events, like TedX, WikiStage
about topics mainly related to tech, you will find in this [repository]([https://link](https://github.com/Timodz/MyPresentations))  some
of those presentations content. 
<br><br>
I was a part of the previous [Guinness world record]([https://link](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/commercial/2018/8/thousands-of-software-developers-from-100-countries-attend-record-breaking-hackat-537231)) of the Most participants in a
hackathon (2018)
